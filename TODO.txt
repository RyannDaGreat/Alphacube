I made the renderer in the gen but NOT in anything else, such as the translations.py or the discriminator trainer!
It HAS to be EVERYWHERE!
TODO:
    Make a more serious attempt. Don't rush this.
    We need image outputs for 6 channels. Why don't we start here? Have 6-channel inputs. Also, render the textures. Try all of that.
    Then, solve the NAN problem. Why are there NAN's?
