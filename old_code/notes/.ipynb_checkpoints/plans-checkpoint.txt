Inputs:
    UV's: A Bx2xHxW tensor with values between 0 and 1
    ItemClass's: A BxHxW unsigned int tensor
        Contains condensed 0,1,2,3 values
        These are the indexes of the ItemCatalog
    LearnedTextures: A Bx3xHxW tensor
        
    
All input UV/ItemClass pairs are the inputs; regardless of whether they come from pairs of RGB-encodedUV/RGB-encoded-class or a single .exr file (we might need to use the former during simulations)
     


class ItemCatalog:
    init(self,dict of blue:name:learnablecolor:condensediindex)
        And some way of getting the tensors that give learnablecolors, and map textures to uv's to get textureprojections
